##1.10

I did this by first cloning the project on the host machine, and then copying it to the Docker image. It could have also been downloaded in the Dockerfile.

```
root@debian-8gb-hel1-docker:~/1.10# docker run -p 5000:5000 ten
```
Output
```
"Exercise 1.10: Congratulations! You configured your ports correctly!"
```
